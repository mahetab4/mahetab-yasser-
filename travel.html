        <h2>spain</h2>
		
		<h3>madrid</h3>
		<p>Madrid is in the exact center of Spain so its location is perfect to discover the country. If you spend a few days in the capital we recommend taking at least one day trip from Madrid. You will be surprised by some unique UNESCO Heritage towns, castles, but also lesser-known villages that are just an hour away from the metropolis.</p>

		<p>Some of the toughest weather I've ever experienced but one of the most serene atmospheres I've ever lived.</p>
